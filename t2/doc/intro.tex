% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit containing a
sinusoidal voltage source $V_S$ connected to seven resistors, $R$, a dependent voltage source, $V_d$, a dependent current source $I_b$ and a capacitor $C$. The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:rc}.


In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
