\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}



In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing the given circuit has been
achieved.\par 
This analyse was performed both theoretically using Octave math tool (computations using the node and mesh method), and by circuit simulation (Ngspice tool).
As we can see, both the node and meshes method, gave the same results as the ones obtained with the circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool. \par
The simulation results matched the theoretical results
precisely. 
The reason for this perfect match is the fact that this is a
straightforward circuit containing only time independent linear components (resistors, voltage and current sources). Furthermore, Ngspice uses the same methods as the ones we used in the theoretical computations, for this reasons the theoretical
and simulation models do not differ. For more complex components, the
theoretical and simulation models could differ, which as we have seen is not the case, for this circuit.
