\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective was to implement an Band-Pass Filter with the highest Merit Figure as possible (this merit figure depends on the price of the components, the Voltage Gain Deviation and the Central Frequency Deviation), using the Octave Math tool and by running a simulation using the Ngspice tool.\\

In this laboratory we obtained similar values in the two analysis. This was due to the fact that the theoretical analysis was based in the values of the simulation itself.  
To conclude, the objective was achieved, since we built an band-pass filter with similar gain and central frequency to the values required.
