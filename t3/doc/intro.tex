\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The objective of this laboratory assignment is to create a AC/DC converter circuit (230V to 12V) using the knowledge  we have acquired in the theoretical classes (lecture 14). We were free to choose the architecture of the Envelope Detector and Voltage regulator circuits. The primal objective was to create an AC/DC circuit with the highest possible merit figure.

This Merit Figure is given by:
\paragraph{}

\begin{equation}
    M = \frac{1}{cost\times(ripple(V0) + average(V0-12) + (10^{-6}))}  
\end{equation}



cost = cost of resistors + cost of capacitors + cost of diodes

cost of resistors = 1 monetary unit (MU) per kOhm

cost of capacitors = 1 MU/$\mu$F

cost of diodes = 0.1 MU per diode
\paragraph{}



The Circuit that we have created and  we are going to analyse in this report, is composed by 23 diodes, one independent voltage source $V_S$, one dependent voltage source $V_2$, a dependent current source $I_1$, two resistors, $R$, and a capacitor $C$.
The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:conv}.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}.The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
