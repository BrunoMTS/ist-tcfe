\label{sec:conclusion}



In this laboratory assignment, the objective was to implement an AC/DC (230/12) [V] with the highest Merit Figure as possible (this merit figure depends on the price of the components, and on the average ripple value), using the Octave Math tool and by running a simulation using the Ngspice tool.\\
In this laboratory we did not obtain the same values in the two analysis. This was due to the fact that the theoretical analysis makes a large number of simplifying approximations when analysing the diode model, that has a more ideal behaviour than the one that is used on the simulation, because of that in the case of the theoretical analysis the ripple was smaller and merit value was bigger than the one computed in the simulation.
