\section{Figure of merit}
\label{sec:results}

The final objective was to obtain a figure of merit as high as possible. 
In this section, we present the final result, after we performed all the analysis

This Merit Figure is given by:
\paragraph{}

\begin{equation}
    M = \frac{VoltageGain \times BandWidth}{Cost \times LowerCutOffFrequency}  
\end{equation}

\paragraph{}

cost = cost of resistors + cost of capacitors + cost of transistors

cost of resistors = 1 monetary unit (MU) per kOhm

cost of capacitors = 1 MU/$\mu$F

cost of transistors = 0.1 MU per transistor

\paragraph{}

Finally, we obtained the important values to calculate the Merit Figure, which we present in the table below. The values used were those of the simulation, since they represent a more accurate approximation of reality.
