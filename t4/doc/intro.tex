\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The objective of this laboratory assignment is to design an Audio Amplifier circuit, using the knowledge  we have acquired in the theoretical classes (lecture 16 and 17). We were free to choose the architecture of the Gain and Output amplifier
stages. The primal objective was to create an Audio Amplifier circuit with the highest possible merit figure.


This Merit Figure is given by:
\paragraph{}

\begin{equation}
    M = \frac{VoltageGain \times BandWidth}{Cost \times LowerCutOffFrequency}  
\end{equation}

\paragraph{}

cost = cost of resistors + cost of capacitors + cost of transistors

cost of resistors = 1 monetary unit (MU) per kOhm

cost of capacitors = 1 MU/$\mu$F

cost of transistors = 0.1 MU per transistor

\paragraph{}

The circuit as is shown in the image below is composed by an independent Voltage Source $V$, a resistor $R_s$, a Gain Stage, a Output Stage and a Speaker.
The circuit can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:audio}.


In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}.The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
