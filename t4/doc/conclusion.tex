\label{sec:conclusion}



In this laboratory assignment, the objective was to implement an Audio Amplifier with the highest Merit Figure as possible (this merit figure depends on the price of the components, the bandwith, the gain and the lower cutoff frequency), using the Octave Math tool and by running a simulation using the Ngspice tool.\\
In this laboratory we did not obtain the same values in the two analysis. This was due to the fact that the theoretical analysis makes a large number of simplifying approximations when analysing the transistor model, that has a more ideal behaviour than the one that is used on the simulation, because of that in the case of the simulation analysis the values were better than the one computed in the theoretical analysis.  
To conclude, the objective was achieved, since we built an audio amplifier with good voltage gain and bandwith.
